Password strength checker (python)

A simple python application for checking the strength of a password, looking at the length, character variety and 
whether it appears on a list of commonly used passwords.

Features
- Password rating (weak, okay, good, strong)
- Detects whether a password is common (using a .txt file)

    This project contains the 'rockyou.txt' file, containing lots of common passwords, however Kali Linux also provides this dictionary file as part of its standard installation.

How to Run
```bash
 python Password_Strength_Checker.py
